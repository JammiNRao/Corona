# Corona
R code and analysis of data from around the world on cases of Corona virus infections.
The data is drawn in from the European Centre for Disease Control. 
The ECDC publish daily updates and so the code will be run every day to produce a report that will be reflect the latest available data
I welcome suggestion and comments on my code, is it the most efficient? and is there more analysis that would be useful
